## Other algorithms and Data structures not seen in the book
Suggestions on what to study after this book

- Trees
    -  B-treee
    -  Red-black trees
    -  Heaps
    -  Splay trees  
- Inverted indexes
    - You do a hashtables about the content, instead of the title, so you can look for the source instead of the content
        - Ex: Do a hash table of the the content in webpages to search for words and then get the link of the pages that have those words
- The Fourier transform
    - It separates the things into its ingredients
        - Ex: A song into its sequences
- Parallel Algorithms
    - Algorithms that can run in diferent cores at the same time
- MapReduce
    - Type of algorithm that can be done in a lot of cores at once to make it fast.
    - Does a process to each slot of the algorithm (map)
    - Then joins the slots into only one result (reduce)
- Bloom filters and HyperLogLog
    - Good when you need to analyze a lot of information, if they say yes, it may be no, but if they say no, then it is really NO
- The SHA algorithms
    - Used as hash functions and to compare things and know if they are diferent or the same
- Locality-sensitive hashing
    - Used to know how similar 2 things are
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    - Used for cryptography(public and private keys)
- Linear programming
    - Used for optimization problems when you have a limitation
