## Introduction - Chapter 1

### What is MERN?

- Stack = combination of technologies
- MERN = Mongo, Express, React and Node.

### MERN Components

#### React

- Open source library created by facebook
- Innovative because it has a virtual dom so that it doesn't have to render all the webpage again
- React is **declarative** because you don't need to worry about DOM manipulation, react will do that for you. You just *declare* how the page is going to look.
- React is **component based**, all you do is contained in components
- React is **Isomorphic** which means it can be run on the server and in the client

#### Node.js

- Javascript which is runable without html

#### Express

- Web server framework
- In MERN express doesn't need a server-side template engine because the dynamic content generation is done on the client with react.

#### Mongo DB

- NOSql = non relational
- Data is denormalized (there can be duplicates)
- Schema less = You don't need a prescribed schema

### Tools and libraries

Other tools that might be needed to build the webapp

#### React Router

- React can only do the rendering and manage interactions between single components but fo transitioning between diferent views adn keeping the browser url in sync you use react router
- It is similar to what express does: usl is parsed, and based on its components an piece of code is associated with it.

#### React Bootstrap

- Special library of bootstrap for react

#### Webpack

- Good for modularizing
- Main function is to build clientside code into a bundle to deliver to the client

### Why MERN

- It uses javascript everywhere
