# Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

## Computer Vision
- The study of visual data

### History of computer vision
- Vision is what caused animal species to explode 500+ million years ago
- 1545  Camera obscura -> first camera
- Hubel & Wiesel 1959 studied how was the visual processing in animals. Checked the electric responses in the brain.
    - They discovered that vision works first with small processing like lines and circles, then edges and corners and then more complex stuff.
- Machine learning techniques started to gain momentum -> ~2001
- 1998 firsts convolutional neural nets

## Books
- Vision - David Marr
- Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville
